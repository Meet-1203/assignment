1. Difference between Web Designer and Web Developer
Ans. The terms web designer and web developer are often used interchangeably, but they actually refer to different roles in the process of creating a website. Here's a breakdown of the differences:

Web Designer
A web designer is focused on the look and feel of a website. They are responsible for the aesthetic and user experience (UX) aspects of the site, ensuring it’s visually appealing and easy to navigate. They work on the layout, colors, fonts, images, and overall design of the site.

Web Developer
A web developer, on the other hand, is responsible for turning the web designer’s vision into a functioning website. They focus on the technical aspects, such as writing code to make the website interactive, functional, and accessible.

There are two main types of developers:

Frontend Developer: Works on the client-side of the website, which is everything users interact with directly in the browser (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
Backend Developer: Works on the server-side, handling databases, server configuration, and ensuring the website functions properly behind the scenes (using languages like PHP, Ruby, Python, or Java).

2.What is a W3C?
Ans. W3C, or the World Wide Web Consortium, is an international community that develops open standards to ensure the long-term growth of the web. It was founded in 1994 by Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, and its mission is to ensure that the web remains a universal, accessible, and interoperable platform for everyone.

Key W3C Standards:
1.HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): Defines the structure of web pages.
2.CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): Controls the layout and design of web pages.
3.XML (Extensible Markup Language): A format for storing and transporting data.

3.What is Domain?
Ans. A domain refers to a specific area or category of activity, control, or expertise within a broader context. However, in the context of the internet, the term "domain" generally refers to a domain name, which is the address or identifier for a website or a network resource.

4.What SEO?
Ans. SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization. It is the practice of improving the visibility and ranking of a website or web page in search engine results pages (SERPs) to attract organic (non-paid) traffic.

In simpler terms, SEO helps websites show up higher in search results when people search for keywords or phrases related to that website. The goal is to make a website more appealing to search engines like Google, Bing, and Yahoo, so they rank the site higher for relevant searches.

5. What is SDLC life cycle?
Ans.The SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) is a structured approach to software development that outlines the process of creating, deploying, and maintaining a software application. It includes a series of stages or phases that guide the development process from the initial concept to the final release and beyond. The SDLC ensures that the software is developed efficiently, within scope, and meets the required quality standards.
