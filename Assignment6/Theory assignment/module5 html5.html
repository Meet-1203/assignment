1. **Doctype Declaration**: 
   - **HTML**: Complex doctype declaration.
   - **HTML5**: Simplified doctype: `<!DOCTYPE html>`.

2. **New Semantic Elements**:

   - **HTML5**: Introduces semantic tags like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, and `<nav>`.

3. **Multimedia Support**: 
   - **HTML**: No native support for audio or video.
   - **HTML5**: Adds `<audio>` and `<video>` tags for multimedia.

4. **APIs**: 
   - **HTML**: Limited APIs.
   - **HTML5**: Introduces APIs like Geolocation, Web Storage, and Web Workers.

5. **Backward Compatibility**: 
   - **HTML5**: Fully backward-compatible with older HTML versions. 








Question 2: What are the additional tags used in HTML5? 
Answer... HTML5 introduced several new tags to improve structure, semantics, and functionality. Some of the key additional tags are:

1. <article> – Represents a self-contained piece of content, like a blog post or news article.
2. <section> – Defines sections in a document, used to group related content.
3. <nav> – Used for navigation links.
4. <header> – Represents the header of a document or a section, typically containing navigation and introductory content.
5. <footer> – Defines the footer of a document or section, usually for copyright info, contact details, etc.
6. <aside> – Represents content that's tangentially related to the main content, like a sidebar.
7. <mark> – Highlights text (used to mark important or relevant content).
8. <progress> – Displays progress of a task (e.g., a progress bar).
9. <output> – Represents the result of a calculation or user action.
10.<details> and <summary> – Used for creating collapsible content. <summary> is the visible heading, and <details> contains the hidden content.
11. <meter> – Represents a scalar value within a known range (e.g., a gauge or a bar).
12. <video> – Embeds a video file.
13. <audio> – Embeds an audio file.
14. <source> – Specifies multiple media resources for elements like `<video>` and `<audio>`.

These tags help make the structure of web content clearer and more meaningful, improving both accessibility and search engine optimization (SEO).
